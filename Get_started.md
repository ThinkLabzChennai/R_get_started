# Preamble 
R is a powerful statistical programming language that is built to work well with large and diverse datasets.   
This notes aims at giving readers a routemap to get started with programming language R and its IDE (Integrated Development Environment) RStudio. We are going to look at how to download, install and understand the basic components of R and RStudio.
 
 
## Downloading And installing R
R software can be downloaded from website  https://cran.r-project.org/
   
The website looks like this.
